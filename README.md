# Exoplanet-project
calculating probabilities of life on planets outside our solarsystem + visualization

In this project, I scraped NASAs Exoplanet Archive and created a Database with all Exoplanets that have been discovered so far. 

I created a machine learning program that fills up blank spaces in the dataset to estimate missing values for those planets as for example their mass, distance to star etc.. 

then i added another row containing all the values of earth as a reference point for later comparison.

I then used the euclidean distance by taking all planets and their values as a vector in multi-dimensional space and compared it to the vector of earth. 

The euclidean distance then showed how far each exoplanets values are from earth's values, hence showing which planet might be very similar to earth.
